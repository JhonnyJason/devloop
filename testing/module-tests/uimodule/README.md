# Component Tests for uimodule

For each exposed function from the uimodule there is one a corresponding test implemented to verify its correctness.

Note: These tests are UI tests which are not automated yet. This way they require manual execution of the test.

## Tested functions

- `retrieveString` in `./test-retrieveString.js`
- `retrieveSecret` in `./test-retrieveSecret.js`
- `retrieveChoice` in `./test-retrieveChoice.js`
